# morsecode-encoder
Code for my Internet of Things Project based internship, on which I had to work on encrypting alphanumeric characters into Morse and decrypt the same. I have tried to add few modifications of my own too, which is still a WIP.

Morse Code, developed by Samuel Morse, is a method used to encode alphabets and numericals into a series of dashes and dots. Every character has a specific set of dases and dots, unique to it. I made this project with Arduino UNO R3 board and Raspberry pi. 

The projected is documented on my hackster page: https://www.hackster.io/priyanka_p1/morsecode-encoder-959c2c <br>
